# Hello 
A simple application to change lowercase letters to uppercase. You can add text (e.g. your name)
 to the text field and choose upper or lower case letters. The text you typed will then
 be displayed on the screen, but using whatever formatting you have selected.
And we use my favorite blue color :)

This taxt was added only for testing GIT GUI

## Properties
